- 👋 Hi, I’m Rob

I got interested in computers since I had an Atari 800XL, similar to a Commodore 64 with 64kb RAM and basic.  Than Amiga 500, 386Dx-40 and a variety of other systems since.

Have done a few programming languages such as AtariBasic, AmigaBasic, M68k Asm, AMOS, Turbo Pascal, GwBasic, Qbasic, Turbo C, x86 Asm, java, vb6, php, js, c#

Though primary languages have been C# .NET since 2005 and Javascript since 2000, with PHP 2000-2005.... along with a few others in between (python, typescript etc)
